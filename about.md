# About the Meta-Brain Project

## Summary (TL;DR)

The Meta-Brain project aims to collect information about other projects that
provide web-based solutions for problems faced by people who are emigrating to
Germany (Europe) and the volunteers who are helping them get settled. This
document describes in more detail [why][] we think this is important, [what][] our
goals are , [who][] we are, and the [status][] of the project.

## Why do you do this? [why]

Many people, on separate occasions (links to resources), have come to the
conclusion that there is a massive duplication of effort when it comes to
web-based solutions for immigration related problems. Even though others have
collected such projects (and we are grateful for that) a manageable overview
(search/filters) that can be integrated (API). (Work packages)
