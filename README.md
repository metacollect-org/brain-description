# Meta-Brain Project Description

The files in this repository describe the Meta-Brain project which consists of:

1. The [backend](backend.md) which includes a database structure and API.
2. The content of the database.
3. A minimal frontend for data management and listing.

You may want to start by reading [about](about.md).

Eventually these files may become part of the minimal frontend hosted at <http://meta.refugeehelper.net>.
